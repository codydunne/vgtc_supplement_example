# Supplemental Material for Global Illumination for Fun and Profit

This project serves as an example for the [VGTC templates](https://github.com/ieeevgtc) of how to provide supplemental material linked with OSF. It is linked to the OSF project at https://osf.io/2nbsg/ (see [OSF's instructions for linking a GitHub repo](https://help.osf.io/article/211-connect-github-to-a-project)) and is mirrored on OSF storage for long-term preservation.
